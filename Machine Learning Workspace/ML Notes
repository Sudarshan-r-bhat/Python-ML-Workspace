in Support vector machines SVM, we use kernel function
for 2-D NON-LINEAR DATA. we convert the data to the higher dimension 3-D and divide into classes using a plane.
(division boundary?)

preprocessing is necessary bcoz sometimes, the datasets we are using might have some text strings. which are strictly
not allowed in ML. Hence Preprocessing encodes all the data in the necessary format.
or we use dummy variables. such as 0, 1 or NO, YES respectively.
